## ⌁ Welcome to Night City, Choom. ::

<img src="preview/johnny.gif" align="right" width="30%" style="margin-left: 20px;">

This is my attempt to recreate Cyberpunk 2077 UI entirely on **Hyprland**, using AGS/Astal to build the HUD similar to the in-game overlay including the widgets, minimaps, and more themed features.

<br clear="right"/>

### About each component

- **Health bars** -> The in-game UI bars meant for Health, Stamina, RAM and Level are copied to provide system monitors:
  - The level badge shows the current active workspace, like [1], [2] and etc.
  -  The Health bars provide average usage in % of CPU load using /proc/stat
  -  The RAM bars...well they provide RAM Memory usage, with ramStat()
  -  the top bar on health for experience, provides the current filesystem storage as `Used/Total` 
  -  The Stamina bar provides the current battery level (if AC, will just stay at 100%)

- **Corner widgets** -> Renders the same UI style of the game UI shortcuts like Radio, Vehicle, Phone, Cyberware item etc
  -  Radio shortcut as Music Player (Toggleable by clicking, or SUPER + SHIFT + O)
  -  System controls for rest of shortcuts like Brightness, Volume, Microphone, Wifi, Bluetooth, Record Screen
  - App tray/Notification center recreated on V's contacts HUD.
    -> the MESSAGES will show the last notifications and their respective apps
    -> the APPS Tray is shows the tray for active apps along with custom tilted context menus

    
- **Minimap** -> Recreates the Minimap from the HUD exactly the same as in-game, showing a random location from `city.json`  
  -  Weather widget below minimap: retrieves the weather forecast for the next 7 days from location at `city.json` using Open Meteo API (Right click to change city location, and double click to see the full forecast)
  -  Network notification: Displays current WiFi/Etherned connected and SSID, or Offline Status along with Upload/Download speed
  -  Market Feed: Shows an interactive widget that displays values and charts for Stocks, Cryptocoins and Trending news. Double-clicking it opens the ''terminal'' that mimicks V computer where you can access websites and buy cars etc, but for market and news.
    
- **Weapon/Item** -> The bottom-right hud that shows weapon/ammo in-game
  -  Shows App Launcher, with a custom icon gathered from the design concepts of Cyberpunk 2077
  -  App Launcher shows a custom launcher that mimicks the Kiroshi Scanner, with audio and animations and the same shape of the 'quickhacks' frames.

- **Pacman hook** -> Displays V's streetcred reputation frame
  - Whenever a new pacman pkg is added, it will show animated frame as "PKG Installed\nVersion XXX" 
  - Whenever AUR packages have upgrades available, it will show update notifications.

- **KILL MODE** -> Starts an animated overlay similar to Kiroshi aswell, click on any app to forcekill it (Toggleable by SUPER+SHIFT+K)
  
- **Screen Recording** -> Starts recording the active screen, and with the same HUD components from in-game when acessing cameras from quickhacks (Toggleable by SUPER+SHIFT+R)

- **Music player** -> Opens/Closes the Media Player, designed pixel-perfect exact as the RADIOPORT in the game. (Toggleable by SUPER+SHIFT+O)
  
- **Quickshell lockscreen** -> ANimated loginscreen with qs.
 
- **Terminals** -> Installs Rio Terminal for 'glassy cyan' cyber terminals, and Cool-Retro-Term by Swordfish90, and sets a 'Netrunner' profile for default, in same style of the terminal windows in-game, along with an optional fish installation and 'SAMURAI' banner.

## ⌁ Requirements

- **Arch Linux or based distros.**
- **Hyprland ≥ 0.56**
- An **AUR helper**: `yay` or `paru` (Always check PKGBUILD btw)
- A running Hyprland session (so theming + first-run setup can apply)

---

## ⌁ Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ARCANGEL0/CyberArch-Dotfiles.git 
cd CyberArch-Dotfiles 
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installer will download any required dependencies, install the theme, quickshell and the necessary packages, along with optional features such as fish, GPU Terminals in theme style, and wallpapers. 

---

## ⌁ Keybinds

There are two modifiers, both set at the top of `theme.lua`:

| Variable | Default | Drives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`MOD`** | `ALT` | Window management — focus, move, workspaces, resize, monitors |
| **`themeMod`** | `SUPER + SHIFT` | The HUD: modals, widgets, capture |

`MOD` defaults to `ALT` because these binds were ported from a niri config that used `mod-key "Alt"`. If Alt starts fighting with application shortcuts — `Alt+Tab`, `Alt+F4`, and the `Alt+<letter>` menu mnemonics in GTK/Qt apps all live there — change the one line:

```lua
local MOD = "SUPER"
```

Every window-management bind follows it. `themeMod` derives from `MOD` automatically and shifts to `SUPER + ALT` when `MOD` is `SUPER`, so the two can never collide.

Open the full cheat-sheet with all keybinds anytime with **`SUPER+SHIFT+H`**.

### HUD & widgets

| Keybind | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `SUPER` / `SUPER + Space` | App launcher |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + Z` | Toggle HUD above / below windows |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + V` | Volume & Microphone modal |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + I` | Brightness modal |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + M` | Messages modal |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + O` | Music player |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + N` | Wi-Fi modal |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + G` | Netterminal: See Stocks, Crypto or News |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + X` | Dismiss Notifications |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + U` | System Upgrade modal |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + B` | Bluetooth modal |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + P` | Power menu |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + W` | 7-day weather forecast (double-click the city to change location) |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + -` | System time: timezone, NTP sync, manual set |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + Y` | Battery modal |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + C` | CPU / RAM / system modal |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + H` | Keybind help |

### System & capture

| Keybind | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + T` | Netrunner terminal (cool-retro-term) |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + S` | Screenshot (region) |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + R` | Start / stop screen recording |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + K` | **Kill mode** (click a window to kill · `ESC` exits) |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + L` | Lock screen |
| `SUPER + D` | Peek desktop (hide windows) — skipped when `MOD` is `SUPER` |
| `MOD + SHIFT + S` | Screenshot (region) |
| `MOD + CTRL + S` | Screenshot (whole active monitor) |
| `Print` | Screenshot (region) |
| `CTRL + SHIFT + ALT + R` | Restart the AGS HUD |
| `SUPER + CTRL + Delete` | `hyprctl reload` |

### Programs

| Keybind | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `MOD + T` | Terminal (`TERM` at the top of `theme.lua`, default `rio`) |
| `MOD + D` | App launcher |
| `MOD + E` | File manager (`kitty -e spf`) |
| `MOD + M` | Run `~/Desktop/mount.sh` |
| `MOD + L` | Lock screen |
| `MOD + P` | Power menu |
| `SUPER + TAB` | App launcher — skipped when `MOD` is `SUPER` |

### Window management

| Keybind | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `MOD + Q` | Close window |
| `MOD + V` | Float / tile toggle |
| `MOD + F` | Maximize |
| `MOD + SHIFT + F` | Fullscreen |
| `MOD + C` | Center window (floating only) |
| `MOD + ← → ↑ ↓` / `MOD + H J K` | Move focus |
| `MOD + Tab` | Cycle to next window |
| `MOD + CTRL + ← → ↑ ↓` / `MOD + CTRL + H J K L` | Move window |
| `MOD + −` / `MOD + =` | Narrower / wider |
| `MOD + SHIFT + −` / `MOD + SHIFT + =` | Shorter / taller |
| `CTRL + SHIFT + ← → ↑ ↓` | Resize window |
| `MOD + LMB` / `MOD + RMB` | Drag / resize with the mouse |

### Monitors

| Keybind | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `MOD + SHIFT + ← → ↑ ↓` / `MOD + SHIFT + H J K L` | Focus monitor |
| `MOD + SHIFT + CTRL + ← → ↑ ↓` / `MOD + SHIFT + CTRL + H L` | Move window to monitor |

The monitor layout itself lives in the `monitors` table near the top of `theme.lua` — not in `hyprland.lua`, because `install.sh` overwrites that file when it detects another desktop shell. Set `MONITORS_VIA_HYPRCTL = true` if your Hyprland build has no `hl.monitor` binding.

### Workspaces

| Keybind | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `MOD + 1…0` | Switch workspace (with the glitch transition) |
| `MOD + CTRL + 1…0` | Send window to workspace |
| `SUPER + 1…0` | Switch workspace — skipped when `MOD` is `SUPER` |
| `MOD + Page Up` / `Page Down`, `MOD + I` / `U` | Previous / next workspace |
| `MOD + CTRL + Page Up` / `Page Down`, `MOD + CTRL + I` / `U` | Send window to previous / next workspace |
| `MOD + scroll up / down` | Previous / next workspace |
| 3-finger swipe (If using notebook)  ← / → | Previous / next workspace |

### Media keys

| Keybind | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `XF86AudioRaiseVolume` / `LowerVolume` | Volume ±10% |
| `XF86AudioMute` / `XF86AudioMicMute` | Mute output / microphone |
| `XF86MonBrightnessUp` / `Down` | Brightness ±10% |

### Session

| Keybind | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `MOD + SHIFT + P` | Power off monitors (`dpms off`) |
| `MOD + SHIFT + E` / `CTRL + ALT + Delete` | Exit Hyprland |
| `MOD + SHIFT + /` | Keybind cheat-sheet |
